In these cases, CVE is making no determination as to which party is correct. Instead, we make note of this dispute and try to offer any public references that will better inform those trying to understand the facts of the issue.When you see a CVE Entry that is ""DISPUTED"", we encourage you to research the issue through the references or by contacting the affected vendor or developer for more information."
